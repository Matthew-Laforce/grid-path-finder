MATH 352 -- Assignment 2 -- Bonus Question

"Consider a 5Ã—5 grid where each cell is either filled or empty, and all 
configurations are equally likely.

Using a computer to count, find the probability that there is a path (going 
left or right; and up or down, but not diagonally) from the bottom of the grid 
to the top only going through filled cells."

Grid Representation:
    25  24  23  22  21
    20  19  18  17  16
    15  14  13  12  11
    10  09  08  07  06
    05  04  03  02  01
Where filled-in cells are represented using a '1', and where empty cells are 
represented using '0'. Then, the binary value 0b1000010000100001000010000 is
a grid with only the rightmost column filled, and nothing else.

def quickcheck(grid):

    Performs a preliminary, relatively fast check of 'grid' looking for two 
    common patterns:
    - If a complete column is found, returns '1' representing a valid path;
    - If an empty row is found, returns '0' indicating no path can exist;

    the more thorough 'deepcheck' method.

    Main method for this question. Uses the helper methods above to determine
    whether individual grids are valid or not.
    
    The grid itself is represented using a 25-digit binary value, with the '1s'
    position corresponding with the bottom-right corner, and with the '25s' 
    position representing the top-left corner.
    
    The grid would begin as 'empty', except no possible valid grid can appear
    until all rows are populated: starting from "0b0000100001000010000100001"
    still ensures no missed values, and saves 1082402 pointless applications of
