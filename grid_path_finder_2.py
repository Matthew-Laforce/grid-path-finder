MATH 352 -- Assignment 2 -- Bonus Question -- Revised Version
Matthew Laforce
Created Jan 28, 2025

"Consider a 5Ã—5 grid where each cell is either filled or empty, and all 
configurations are equally likely.

Using a computer to count, find the probability that there is a path (going 
left or right; and up or down, but not diagonally) from the bottom of the grid 
to the top only going through filled cells."

(New) Grid Representation:
    01  02  03  04  05
    06  07  08  09  10
    11  12  13  14  15
    16  17  18  19  20
    21  22  23  24  25
Where filled-in cells are represented using a '1', and where empty cells are 
represented using '0'. Then, the binary value 0b1000010000100001000010000 is
a grid with only the rightmost column filled, and nothing else.

The revised version fixes the grid for clarity: in the original code, the 
grid was relatively rotated 180 degrees, such that the top-left cell was
25, and such that the bottom-right was 1. This can work, but it's less clear
and in hindsight there's no reason to format it like this. 

More importantly, the leading digits in binary values were dropped in the
original, causing a miscount. The logic for 'quickcheck' was fixed, preventing
a second miscount.

Improvements were also made to the performance and readability of the code.

    the more thorough 'deepcheck' method.

    Main method for this question. Uses the helper methods above to determine
    whether individual grids are valid or not.
    
    The grid itself is represented using a 25-digit binary value, where the
    value 0b1000000000000000000000000 represents the top-left cell (cell 1), 
    and where 0b0000000000000000000000001 represents the bottom-right cell 
    (cell 25).
    
    The grid would begin as 'empty', except no possible valid grid can appear
    until all rows are populated: starting from "0b0000100001000010000100001"
    still ensures no missed values, and saves 1082402 pointless applications of 
    'quickcheck'.
